Contains Essential Python Beginner Lessons 

It is a walkthrough and major coverage of Python tutorials from thenewboston YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston

Some or most of the exact tutorial programs have been edited to allow for more concept coverage(self-experimentation).
Hopefully these sessions(lessons) serve as a quick reference guide for programmers beginning their journey to the world of Python.

As you follow along you may refer to the word document file -
Python - The New Boston.docx (https://github.com/abhijitroynits/python_practice_noob/blob/master/Python%20-%20The%20New%20Boston.docx)

I have used PyCharm IDE for composing the programs. 


P.S: The referred word doc has the snapshots of program execution.
